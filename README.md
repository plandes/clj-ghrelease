a [GitHub release](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/).  This
software is meant to replace
the [manual](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) process.

## Obtaining

The latest release binaries are
available [here](https://github.com/plandes/clj-ghrelease/releases/latest).

## Usage

This is a command line application that has the following usage (given with `-h`):
```sql
usage: ghrelease [options] <file1> [file2]...
create a GitHub release
  -l, --level <log level>          INFO    Log level to set in the Log4J2 system.
  -r, --repo <user/repo name>              the repository identifier (ex: plandes/clj-ghrelease)
  -t, --tag <v?[0-9.]+|latest>     latest  the version format tag of the release (ex: v0.0.1)
  -n, --name <name>                        the optional name of the release, which defaults to the latest tag
      --nodelete                           don't delete current release if it exists already
  -d, --description <description>          the optional description of the release
  -c, --changelog <CHANGELOG.md>           description is parsed from changelog (default to repo)
  -p, --prerelease                         indicate this is a pre-release
```

The only argument required is the repository name.  The tag defaults to the
latest tag and the description defaults to the tag's version found in the
`CHANGELOG.md`.


### Changelog

This tool parses the `CHANGELOG.md` to create the description for the release.
The file format *must* follow
the [keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/).  If no changelog file is
given on the command line it is taken from master HEAD ref content currently
committed to the repository (see [Changelog](#changelog)).  This can be
overridden by providing a `-d` option.


## Building

To build from source, do the folling:

- Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) (this is just a script)
- Install [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- Download the source: `git clone https://github.com/clj-nlp-feature && cd clj-nlp-feature`
- Download the make include files:
```bash
mkdir ../clj-zenbuild && wget -O - https://api.github.com/repos/plandes/clj-zenbuild/tarball | tar zxfv - -C ../clj-zenbuild --strip-components 1
```
- Compile: `make compile` do compile or `make install` to install in your local
  maven repo.


## Use as a Clojure Library

This software is written in Clojure and can be used in your own Clojure (or
Java) program.  For example, you could create
a [Leiningen plugin](https://nakkaya.com/2010/02/25/writing-leiningen-plugins-101/).


### Obtaining

In your `project.clj` file, add:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/ghrelease/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/ghrelease/)
